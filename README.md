# Assessment 1: NLP Recommendation Engine

## Summary

In this project, we developed a content-based NLP recommendation engine for Australian school teachers to suggest textbooks based on their requirements. We used Python to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Data acquisition: Utilized external APIs (such as Google Books API and Trove API) to augment the provided dataset with additional information about the textbooks.

2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: Performed text data wrangling, exploratory text data analysis, and NLP preprocessing to prepare the dataset for modeling.

3. Feature engineering: Extracted relevant features from the textual data to represent each textbook for the recommendation model.

4. Model development: Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create the content-based recommendation engine.

5. Model evaluation: Assessed the quality of the recommendation engine using F1 score and other relevant metrics.

Our recommendation engine successfully provided textbook suggestions based on the input criteria (school, year level, and subject), demonstrating the potential of NLP-powered recommendation systems in the education sector. Future improvements could include incorporating additional data sources or refining the user group definitions to enhance the model's performance.
